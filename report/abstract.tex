\section*{Abstract}
The Ywing is a VTOL (vertical take off and landing) drone capable of flying at any speed between its cruise speed and hover by varying its angle of attack. The angle of attack (angle between wing chord and airflow) cannot always be approximated by pitch angle (angle between wing chord and horizon) because the drone is not always flying at constant altitude or undergoes some wind. The goal of this project was to use optic flow measurements from a wide field of view camera embedded on the drone to estimate the angle of attack. Indeed, in translation flight, all optic flow vectors point to the current direction of flight, which can be used to estimate the angle of attack. The estimation of direction of motion was implemented on the onboard controller using optic flow vectors computed on the camera, and validated using motion tracking systems.
