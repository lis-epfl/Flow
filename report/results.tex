\section{Results \& Discussion}
\subsection{Setup}
% Experiments were conducted moving the camera by hand in a synthetic environment (i.e. textured walls) while recording its full displacement thanks to a motion capture system. These experiments were meant to assess the performance of the method described in Section II for estimating the direction of motion but may not be representative of its actual robustness under all conditions (different illumination, environment textures, etc.).

% Describe optic-flow sensor board (chip + gyroscope)
% Describe lens (sunex)
% Describe sampling directions and number (and why)
% Describe image caching (built in function) and gyroscope sampling (same)
% Describe the remaining elements (sampling rate, algorithm run on chip)

% Descripton: PX4Flow is an optical flow smart camera (it provides the image for setup purposes, but it not designed to capture images like a webcam). It has a native resolution of 752×480 pixels and calculates optical flow on a 4x binned and cropped area at 400 Hz, giving it a very high light sensitivity. Unlike many mouse sensors, it also works indoors and in low outdoor light conditions without the need for an illumination LED. It can be freely reprogrammed to do any other basic, efficient low-level computer vision task.

% The optic-flow measurements are sampled at 200Hz while the full direction of motion estimation algorithm is run on the optic-flow sensor chip. 

% Experiments were performed using an OptiTrack motion capture system which high precision allowed to estimate the ground truth measurements. The optic-flow sensor was mounted on a frame equipped with 5 markers (coated with a reflective material) attached at known positions to obtain the three-dimensional position and orientation of the rigid body. The motion of the camera was recorded at 250Hz. The measured orientation are differentiated so as to obtain the angular rates of the rigid body, which are compared to the gyroscopes measurements for synchronization purposes (convolution).

% Motion capture using passive markers requires the emission of IR lights that are sensed by the camera due to its small size. Due to the frequency at which these articial lights were emitted (250Hz), the ambiant illumination as seen by the camera (200Hz) typically changed at 1.3Hz inducing an automatic calibration of the luminosity, which requires extra 5ms before new readings are sampled. Although this setup was kept due to time constraints, this issue could be avoided by switching of IR lights and using active markers (i.e. a set IR LEDs).
